Work-In-Progress

Rudimentary tic-tac-toe AI using an implementation of the minimax algorithm.

There is currently no input validation and the human always goes second.

Planned improvements:
1. Bug fixing: (Found a bug where the AI does not play optimally at certain states)
2. Player gets to choose whether to go first or second
3. Alpha-beta pruning
4. Input validation
5. Modularise code
6. Simple JavaFX GUI
